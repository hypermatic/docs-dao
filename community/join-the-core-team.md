In practice, when you apply for a Core Team job, your application experience is similar to a traditional job. We'll need some reassurances that you can do what you claim you can and there'll be an interview. Once you have convinced us of your ability to excel in the job, there are various terms on which the DAO can engage you:

1. **Directly via Growth Fund**: TCR and/or crypto denominated payments. Subject to 1-month termination. Remuneration is public information.
2. **Directly via Governance**: TCR and/or crypto denominated payments. Requires a successful proposal to the DAO, which an existing Core Team can help you draft. Subject to immediate termination by a governance vote. Remuneration is public information.
3. **Employment via Mycelium**: TCR and/or fiat payments to a bank account. Australia only. Subject to Australian employment laws.
4. **Contracting via Mycelium**: TCR and/or fiat payments to a bank account. Must receive payments as a corporate entity (e.g. LLC). Subject to 1-month termination.
