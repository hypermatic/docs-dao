# Governors

Tracer DAO governors are at the forefront of financial innovation and act to guide the transition from the current way we do digital finance to a more secure and scalable system. Governors are responsible for creating and managing efficient financial tools and protocols that will become the standard financial transaction layer for the future. The operation of the DAO includes:

* Choosing to install new financial contracts to the Factory.
* Allocating TCR governance tokens to ecosystem initiatives.
* Choosing to perform liquidity mining programs.

Each decision made by Tracer DAO must be debated with rigor and objectivity. As Tracer’s success is dependent on good governance, governors should stay up-to-date with Tracer and its resources.&#x20;

### Become a Governor

You can become a governor and propose and vote within Tracer DAO on **Ethereum** and **Arbitrum** by simply holding governance tokens.&#x20;

### How to Govern

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Create Governance Proposals" %}
1. **Create a Discourse proposal in the ‘**[_Expression of Interest_](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/about-the-eoi-category/111)**’ category.**\
   ****This enables anyone to easily create a proposal to suggest an improvement to the Tracer DAO ecosystem. DAO members indicate through a poll if they would like the proposal to proceed and be formalised in preparation for an on-chain vote.\

2. **If your initial proposal receives majority vote, a DAO member will create a formal proposal in the ‘**[_System Proposals_](https://discourse.tracer.finance/c/dao-proposals/proposal-lobby/13)**‘ category.**\
   ****The formal proposal allows DAO members to understand all aspects of the proposal, including any deliverables, considerations, conflicts of interests, and payments required. DAO members indicate if they would like the formal proposal should be pushed to Snapshot for on-chain voting through a poll.\

3. **If the formal proposal receives majority vote, a DAO member will push it to** [**Snapshot**](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth) **for on-chain voting.**\
   ****
4. **Two-day voting process commences on Snapshot.**\
   Governers have two days to vote on the proposal on Snapshot. If the proposal reaches a majority vote it successfully passes voting.\

5. **If the vote is successful, the proposal is implemented and pushed to GitHub.**\
   This either done by you, the proposer, or Mycelium.\

6. **The proposal is pushed on-chain by a DAO member.**\
   Any DAO member can push the proposal on-chain through Etherscan.\

7. **One-week multi-sig relay occurs in order for the proposal to be executed on-chain.**\
   ****After a two-day warm-up period, the multi-sig voters have three-days to relay the results from the Snapshot vote. This is followed by a two-day cool down period, and then the proposal is executed on-chain.
